MapReduce Implementation in Python using Google Colab
----------------

In this work the process of MapReduce task is mimicked. Specifically, we will write our own map and reduce functions (without distributing to several machines) to mimic the process of mapper and reducer.

The task is to count the number of occurrences of each word in a text file.

Tasks:

1) Preparing the data.

2) Writing map and reduce functions.

3) Getting a better understanding of how mapper and reducer work.
